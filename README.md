Indian Presidential Election Prediction Model
The President of India is indirectly elected by an Electoral College consisting of the elected members of
both houses of parliament, the elected members of the Legislative assemblies of the 28 states, and the elected members of
the legislative assemblies of the Union Territories of Delhi, Puducherry and Jammu and Kashmir. Experimental results
show that the proposed Prediction Model can show the value of votes of elected Members of the Legislative Assemblies,
Members of Parliament from each state & party in the Electoral College.
